# Project Review: Automobile Sales Recession Analysis

## Current Status: ⚠️ Needs Improvement for CV

### Strengths ✅
- Interactive Dash dashboard
- Multiple visualizations (11 charts)
- Uses relevant libraries (pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, plotly, dash)
- Clear business context

### Critical Issues ❌

1. **Missing README.md** - Essential for recruiters to understand your project
2. **No requirements.txt** - Makes it impossible to reproduce
3. **Basic Analysis** - Only descriptive statistics, no advanced techniques
4. **Code Quality** - Typo in dashboard title ("Statisitics")
5. **No Deployment** - Not hosted anywhere (GitHub Pages, Heroku, etc.)
6. **Limited Documentation** - Minimal code comments
7. **Superficial Insights** - Observations lack statistical rigor

## Recommendations to Make CV-Ready

### 1. Add Professional README.md
Include:
- Project overview and objectives
- Key findings and insights
- Technologies used
- Installation instructions
- Screenshots/GIFs of dashboard
- Future improvements

### 2. Add requirements.txt
List all dependencies with versions

### 3. Enhance Analysis
Add:
- Statistical tests (correlation analysis, t-tests)
- Time series analysis (trend decomposition, forecasting)
- Machine learning (predictive models)
- Hypothesis testing
- Advanced visualizations (heatmaps, correlation matrices)

### 4. Improve Code Quality
- Fix typos
- Add docstrings
- Refactor dashboard code
- Add error handling
- Follow PEP 8 style guide

### 5. Deploy Dashboard
- Deploy to Heroku, Streamlit Cloud, or GitHub Pages
- Add live demo link to README

### 6. Add Advanced Features
- Data preprocessing pipeline
- Statistical analysis section
- Predictive modeling
- Export functionality
- More interactive filters

### 7. Professional Documentation
- Add docstrings to functions
- Document data sources
- Explain methodology
- Add architecture diagram

## What Recruiters Look For

✅ **Technical Skills**: Advanced analysis, clean code, best practices
✅ **Business Impact**: Clear insights, actionable recommendations
✅ **Professionalism**: README, deployment, documentation
✅ **Problem-Solving**: Complex challenges, innovative solutions

## Current Grade: C+ (Needs Work)

With improvements: Could reach **B+ to A-**

## Quick Wins (Do These First)

1. Create README.md (30 min)
2. Add requirements.txt (5 min)
3. Fix typo in dashboard (1 min)
4. Deploy dashboard (1-2 hours)
5. Add statistical analysis section (2-3 hours)
